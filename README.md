# GSA-API-Call

This is still a work in progress as of December 6, 2024

This is a program to automate determining the cost of an individual to travel using the GSA API database
There are 2 options that will be added over time:
1. Enter the dates for a single trip via message boxes
2. Enter an Excel spreadsheet that has any number of trips and get the cost totals for each one

Make sure that your firewall rules allow you to make outbound requests because I ran into issues doing this
